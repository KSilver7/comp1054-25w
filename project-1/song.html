            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>Remember again</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inside a world of broken words
            you cannot hide
            you try to find the reasons why,
            as days collide
            the seconds keep on passing,
            without a sound, you turn around
            and as you walk away
            I call to you
            Don't you let go
            take a look around,
            you are not alone
            if you'd only stop
            and close your eyes
            find the answers,
            you'd find the answers
            when you feel like the world
            if falling in
            and you can't seem to find
            the way back in
            don't cry
            just hear these words
            and remember again</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside, you're trembling
            as you stand,
            in the falling rain
            you try to find
            where you belong,
            as you drown the pain
            You hear the voices crying
            inside a world monochrome
            but their eyes are bleeding
            tears of magenta
            Don't you let go
            take another breath
            when you're lost again
            if you'd only break
            the walls within
            find the courage,
            you'd find the courage
            when you feel like the world
            if falling in
            and you can't seem to find
            the way back in
            don't cry
            just hear these words
            and remember again
            Another silent prayer fades
            as the night slips past
            I try to reach out to the light
            through the glass as it shatters</p>
            <br>
            <p>Don't you let go
            take a look around,
            you are not alone
            if you'd only stop
            and close your eyes
            find the answers,
            you'd find the answers
            when you feel like the world
            if falling in
            and you can't seem to find
            the way back in
            don't cry
            just hear these words
            and remember
            Don't you let go
            take another breath
            when you're lost again
            if you'd only break
            the walls within
            find the courage,
            you'd find the courage
            when you feel like the world
            if falling in
            and you can't seem to find
            the way back in
            don't cry
            just hear these words
            and remember again
            you'd find the answers
            find the answers</p>
